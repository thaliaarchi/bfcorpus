# PipeVM Brainfuck programs

Brainfuck programs from the [PipeVM](https://github.com/lestrozi/pipevm) project
by Luis Fernando Estrozi. PipeVM is binary protocol, which operates over
standard I/O and provides devices to extend the capabilities of programs using
it, including an ASCII console, graphics, keyboard input, and a filesystem. The
VM is run in Python and drives I/O with a program over a pipe. These programs
are current as of commit [0f788a0](https://github.com/lestrozi/pipevm/commit/0f788a0d4faba4caef1a8d72ec32ef949f627dc8)
