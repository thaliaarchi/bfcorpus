The programs listed below are written by me (rdebath) and so are officially
relased as public domain or CC0. The other BF programs are either written
by third parties or mechanical translations of such and so not covered by
this note.  However, unless noted within the original file, you have a good
faith expectation that nobody cares, so they are public domain by default.
