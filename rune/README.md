- [bfpretty.b](https://web.archive.org/web/20061104091526/http://rune.krokodille.com/lang/code/bfpretty.b):
  Utility program which prettifies Brainfuck programs. That is, it removes all
  non-bf characters and whitespace, and outputs the source with 80 characters
  per line. For an example, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20081121085800/http://rune.krokodille.com/lang/code/bfpretty2.b)
  is the result of bfpretty applied to itself. The only Brainfuck program I've
  written that is actually "useful".
- [polyglot.txt](https://web.archive.org/web/20090107031445/http://rune.krokodille.com/lang/code/polyglot.txt).b:
  A five language polyglot that prints out “Hello World!”. The languages are
  Brainfuck, Befunge, Kipple, ORK and Chef.
