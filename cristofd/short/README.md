# An assortment of small programs

Although brainfuck is basically useless, it isn't quite so crashingly useless
as people usually say. Some small tasks can be done fairly concisely.
(Some of these are fairly UNIX-specific.)

These programs are split from [short.b](https://www.brainfuck.org/short.b),
which is short.b.orig here.
